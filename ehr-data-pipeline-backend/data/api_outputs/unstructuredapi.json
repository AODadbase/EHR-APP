She does have some very mild chest pain, which she says has been present for quite a while, several months, but did improve, and then came back over the past 2 to 3 weeks after sustained coughing fits. She does note that she has quite a sustained cough starting from February that has not changed recently. We do note that this is significant enough to cause her posttussive emesis on a somewhat regular basis, though she was not able to quantify how often. Ms. J also endorses a history of 6 weeks of migratory polyarthralgia. It initially started in her left hand, where she had an area of erythema that was tender to touch. She did have decreased mobility in that wrist, but was able to sustain some movement. It then spread up into 2 or 3 of her fingers, no particular distribution and limited mobility in them entirely. This pain persisted for 3 to 5 days and then resolved spontaneously. She had a week of no pain, and then the pain appeared similarly in her right hand. This pattern continued and currently she has this pain in her left ankle. She is not able to significantly move her ankle. At this point, it is quite tender and she is having difficulty ambulating given the pain.",
